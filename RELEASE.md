## The `./go` script: a unified development environment interface

Source: https://github.com/mbland/go-script-bash

A `./go` script aims to abstract away many of the steps needed to develop (and sometimes deploy) a software project. It is a replacement for READMEs and other documents that may become out-of-date, and when maintained properly, should provide a cohesive and discoverable interface for common project tasks.

The `./go` script idea came from Pete Hodgson's blog posts [In Praise of the ./go Script: Part I](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i) and [Part II](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-ii).

**Note:** The `./go` script concept is completely unrelated to the [Go programming language](https://golang.org), though the Go language's `go` command encapsulates many common project functions in a similar fashion.
